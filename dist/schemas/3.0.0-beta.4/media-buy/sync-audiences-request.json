  "description": "Request parameters for managing CRM-based audiences on an account with upsert semantics. Existing audiences matched by audience_id are updated, new ones are created. Members are specified as delta operations: add appends new members, remove drops existing ones. Recommend no more than 100,000 members per call; for larger lists, chunk and call incrementally using add/remove deltas. When delete_missing is true, buyer-managed audiences on the account not in this request are removed — do not combine with omitted audiences or all buyer-managed audiences will be deleted. When audiences is omitted, the call is discovery-only: it returns all audiences on the account without modification.",
